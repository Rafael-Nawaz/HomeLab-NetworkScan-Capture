### Title: **Network Scanning and Traffic Analysis using Nmap and Wireshark in a Virtualized Environment**

---

### **Project Overview**

In this project, I set up a controlled environment using Oracle VM VirtualBox to create two virtual machines: one running Ubuntu and the other Kali Linux. The primary goal was to demonstrate how network scanning tools like Nmap can be used to map out open ports and services on a target machine, and how traffic analysis tools like Wireshark can be employed to capture and analyze the network traffic generated by such scans.

### **Step-by-Step Breakdown**

#### **1. Setting Up the Virtual Environment**

**Objective:** Create a controlled network environment for security testing without affecting the actual network infrastructure.

**Tools Used:**
- **Oracle VM VirtualBox:** A powerful x86 and AMD64/Intel64 virtualization product that allows users to run multiple operating systems on a single physical machine.
- **Ubuntu (Target Machine):** A popular Linux distribution, chosen as the target for scanning.
- **Kali Linux (Attacker Machine):** A Debian-based distribution used for penetration testing, which comes pre-installed with various security tools, including Nmap and Wireshark.

**Explanation:** 
In this initial step, I set up two virtual machines (VMs) within Oracle VM VirtualBox. The Ubuntu VM was designated as the target machine, while the Kali Linux VM was set up as the attacker machine. Virtual machines allow you to create isolated environments for testing, ensuring that any actions taken within the VMs do not affect the host system or other networks.

#### **2. Network Mapping with Nmap**

**Objective:** Identify open ports and services running on the target machine (Ubuntu) by performing a network scan using Nmap.

**Command Executed:** `nmap -A 10.0.2.15` (from the Kali Linux VM)

**Explanation:** 
- **Nmap (Network Mapper):** A free and open-source utility for network discovery and security auditing. The `-A` option enables OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute.
- **IP Address:** `10.0.2.15` was the IP address assigned to the Ubuntu VM by VirtualBox.

By executing the `nmap -A` command from the Kali Linux VM, I initiated a scan on the Ubuntu VM. This scan aimed to gather detailed information about the target, including open ports, services running on those ports, and the operating system in use. The Nmap tool sends packets to the target IP address and analyzes the responses to deduce this information.

#### **3. Configuring the Firewall on Ubuntu**

**Objective:** Set up a basic firewall on the Ubuntu VM to control incoming traffic.

**Commands Executed:**
- `sudo ufw enable`
- `sudo ufw allow ssh`
- `sudo ufw allow from 10.0.2.4`

**Explanation:**
- **UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall):** A user-friendly frontend for managing iptables, designed to simplify the process of configuring a firewall on Linux systems.
- **`sudo ufw enable`:** Activates the UFW firewall, which begins enforcing the rules you set.
- **`sudo ufw allow ssh`:** Allows SSH connections, which are typically on port 22. This rule is crucial for maintaining secure remote access to the machine.
- **`sudo ufw allow from 10.0.2.4`:** Specifically allows traffic from the Kali Linux VM (which has the IP address `10.0.2.4`), thereby controlling and limiting access to the Ubuntu VM.

This step involved configuring the Ubuntu VM's firewall to allow only specific types of traffic. By enabling UFW and setting rules to allow SSH and traffic from the Kali VM, I ensured that the Ubuntu machine was not completely exposed to all potential threats but was still accessible for the intended scan.

#### **4. Installing and Running Wireshark on Ubuntu**

**Objective:** Capture and analyze network traffic during the Nmap scan.

**Tool Used:** 
- **Wireshark:** A network protocol analyzer that allows you to capture and interactively browse the traffic running on a computer network.

**Explanation:**
After installing Wireshark on the Ubuntu VM, I prepared it to monitor and capture all incoming traffic. Wireshark captures packets of data transmitted over the network, which can then be analyzed to understand the nature of the traffic.

#### **5. Re-running the Nmap Scan and Analyzing Traffic**

**Objective:** Observe and analyze the network traffic generated by the Nmap scan using Wireshark.

**Command Re-executed:** `nmap -A 10.0.2.15` (from Kali Linux VM)

**Explanation:**
With Wireshark running on the Ubuntu VM, I re-executed the Nmap scan from the Kali Linux VM. This time, as Nmap probed the Ubuntu machine, Wireshark captured the traffic data. 

In Wireshark, I could observe various packets, including SYN packets used by Nmap to discover open ports, and responses from the Ubuntu VM. This allowed me to see exactly how Nmap interacts with a target machine during a scan and provided insights into the types of data that could be intercepted during such an operation.

### **Project Significance and Insights**

This project demonstrates several critical aspects of cybersecurity:

- **Network Scanning:** The Nmap tool is commonly used by both security professionals and malicious actors to discover vulnerabilities in a network. Understanding how it works is essential for both offense (penetration testing) and defense (securing systems).
  
- **Firewall Configuration:** Proper firewall rules are vital for protecting systems from unauthorized access. This project highlighted how firewalls can be configured to allow specific traffic while blocking everything else.

- **Traffic Analysis:** Wireshark is a powerful tool for network analysis. By capturing the traffic generated during the Nmap scan, I could see firsthand what information is exchanged during such operations and how it might be intercepted or analyzed.

- **Virtualization:** Using VirtualBox to create isolated environments for testing ensures that experiments do not impact real-world systems, making it an ideal setup for learning and practicing cybersecurity techniques.

Overall, this project provided practical experience in using some of the most critical tools in cybersecurity, helping to deepen my understanding of network security and the importance of monitoring and protecting networked systems.
